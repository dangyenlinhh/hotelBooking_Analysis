# Project overview
This project utilized **Tableau Prep** for data preprocessing, and **Tableau Desktop** for creating storytelling including dashboards illustrating booking and cancellation trends, analyzing cancellation reasons, and providing forecasts for the upcoming year. In addition, I also proposed solutions to increase the number of bookings and minimize cancellations.

# About Dataset 

This dataset contains 87396 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel
Booking between the 1st of July 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled.

The data is originally from the article [Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

The data I used in this project was adjusted by Th.S Doan Thi Tram.
